This project establishes the central development and maintenance of syntax definition
files for the PowerShell language used by editors that leverage the XML version of the
[TextMate language grammar format](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars).

Currently this syntax definition is used in the following editors and extensions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) by Microsoft
- [PowerShell Package for Sublime Text](https://github.com/SublimeText/PowerShell) by [Guillermo LÃ³pez-Anglada](https://github.com/guillermooo)
- [language-powershell for Atom](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/language-powershell) by [James Sconfitto](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/)

In the future we may find a more common syntax that allows us to generate syntax
definitions for editors that don't leverage the TextMate format.

## Status

We are starting with the current state of the TextMate grammar that is being used in
both VS Code and Sublime Text.  There are a number of existing issues with the grammar
that we need to track down and fix.  Please see [issue #1](https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax/issues/1)
for more details.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Prerequisites

- Node.JS, >= 8.9.1
- Atom text editor (tests)

### Build (build.ps1)

1. Run `build.ps1` to generate the grammar.

    ```
    PS> .\build.ps1
    ```

2. The .json file will be generated in `./grammars/` at the root of the project.

### Test (build.ps1)

> Requires the Atom text editor be installed.

1. Run `.\build.ps1` with `-Test`. Which will build the grammar file and run all of the specs.

    ```
    PS> .\build.ps1 -Test
    ```

### Build (npm)

1. Use `npm` to install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the `build-grammar` script to generate the json file.

    ```
    npm run build-grammar
    ```

3. The .json file will be generated in `./grammars/` at the root of the project.

### Test (Atom cli)

1. Build the grammar file using the above steps.

3. Use the Atom cli command for your os (atom.cmd or atom.sh) to run the tests from the root of the EditorSystax project folder.

    ```
    atom --test spec
    ```
=======
Ultimately we are looking at doing a total refactoring of the grammar file.

## Contributing

We would love to have community contributions to this project to make PowerShell syntax
highlighting great in as many editors as we can.  Please feel free to file issues or
send pull requests if you'd like to contribute.

### Workflow

Build and test scripts are provided that requires node and tasks are included for Visual Studio Code.

To get started contributing:

- Install node (if not installed already)
- Clone this repository locally
- run ``npm install`` to install the node dependencies

After you have made changes to ``PowerShellSyntax.YAML-tmLanguage``, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to start the build task. This will convert the file to _plist_, _JSON_ and _CSON_ as well as run the tests to make sure that nothing breaks.

The converted files are saved to the **grammars** folder.

If you want to preview the changes locally, and are running Windows (with PowerShell), you can use the included helper scripts ``useThisGrammar.ps1`` and ``useOriginalGrammar.ps1`` to change between the original and the grammar file from this repository.

Note that you need to run these scripts as Administrator, and you also need to reload Visual Studio Code to read the new grammar file.

### Tests

The test script are using the file ``referenceFile.yaml`` to test the tokens and their assigned scopes.

If you make any changes to the grammar file, remember to also update the reference file and/or ``test.ps1`` if needed; or the tests will fail.
